# Tasks: Personal Assistant Discord Bot

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-discord-assistant-bot/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Fresh app**: `routes/`, `islands/`, `lib/`, `data/`
- Paths reference the unified Fresh application structure for Deno Deploy

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure for Deno Deploy

- [x] T001 Create Fresh application structure per plan.md (routes/, islands/, lib/, data/, etc.)
- [x] T002 Initialize Deno project with deno.json and Fresh configuration
- [ ] T003 [P] Setup Deno Deploy configuration (deploy.yml)
- [x] T004 [P] Create environment variable templates and Deno Deploy secrets setup
- [x] T005 [P] Configure TypeScript strict mode and linting (deno.json)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T006 Setup embedded data modules structure in data/ directory
- [x] T007 [P] Implement Discord OAuth2 authentication system in lib/auth/
- [x] T008 [P] Create shared TypeScript types in lib/types/

- [x] T011 Configure environment management and validation in lib/config/
- [x] T012 [P] Setup health check API routes in routes/api/health.ts
- [x] T013 Create Discord client initialization in lib/discord/client.ts

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Discord Mention Webhook Integration (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Forward Discord mentions to n8n workflow via webhooks with retry logic

**Independent Test**: Bot processes mentions and successfully POSTs to webhook endpoint

### Tests for User Story 1 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Web-Based Reminder Management (Priority: P2)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Pattern-Based Text Recognition (Priority: P3)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before handlers/routes
- Core implementation before CLI interfaces
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):
Task: "Contract test for webhook payload format in bot/tests/contract/test_webhook_api.ts"
Task: "Integration test for Discord mention handling in bot/tests/integration/test_mention_flow.ts"
Task: "Unit test for retry logic in bot/tests/unit/test_webhook_retry.ts"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create WebhookCall model in bot/src/models/webhook_call.ts"
Task: "Create BotInteraction model in bot/src/models/bot_interaction.ts"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (if tests included)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Follow constitution requirements: CLI-first, TDD, modular architecture, observability

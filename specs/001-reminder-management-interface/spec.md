# Feature Specification: Reminder Management Web Interface

**Feature Branch**: `001-reminder-management-interface`  
**Created**: 2025-10-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "A web interface to manage, add and edit Reminders that are sent through a Discord Bot to a specific users DMs. But the Interface is able to set which User ID the Bot sends the reminder to, and will escalate the reminder to a second user that is also specified in the interface if the reminder times out or is manually declined by the primary reminder recipient. Add to this spec that there should also be a way to test reminder Triggers"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create Basic Reminder (Priority: P1)

A system administrator creates a new reminder through the web interface, specifying the message content, target Discord user ID, and when the reminder should be sent. The reminder is successfully delivered to the specified user's Discord DMs at the scheduled time.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality that demonstrates the basic value proposition - creating and delivering reminders via Discord bot.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a reminder with a future timestamp, verifying it appears in the interface, and confirming delivery to the Discord user.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** admin is on the reminder creation page, **When** they enter reminder text, target user ID, and schedule time, **Then** reminder is saved and appears in the reminder list
2. **Given** a scheduled reminder exists, **When** the scheduled time arrives, **Then** the Discord bot sends the reminder message to the specified user's DMs
3. **Given** admin creates a reminder with invalid user ID, **When** they submit the form, **Then** system displays validation error

---

### User Story 2 - Edit and Manage Existing Reminders (Priority: P2)

A system administrator views a list of all reminders (pending, sent, completed), can edit reminder details before they are sent, and can delete unwanted reminders. They can see the status of each reminder and when it was last updated.

**Why this priority**: Essential management capabilities that make the system practical for ongoing use beyond just creating reminders.

**Independent Test**: Create several reminders, verify they appear in the list, edit one reminder's content and schedule, delete another, and confirm changes persist.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** admin is on the reminder dashboard, **When** they view the reminder list, **Then** all reminders are displayed with status, target user, and schedule information
2. **Given** admin selects an undelivered reminder, **When** they modify the content and save, **Then** the reminder is updated with new content and schedule
3. **Given** admin deletes a pending reminder, **When** they confirm deletion, **Then** reminder is removed and will not be delivered

---

### User Story 3 - Escalation Management (Priority: P3)

A system administrator sets up escalation rules when creating a reminder, specifying a secondary Discord user ID who will receive the reminder if the primary recipient doesn't respond within a specified timeout period or manually declines the reminder.

**Why this priority**: Advanced functionality that adds significant value for important reminders that require guaranteed acknowledgment.

**Independent Test**: Create a reminder with escalation settings, have primary user decline or ignore, and verify secondary user receives the escalated reminder.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** admin creates a reminder with escalation enabled, **When** they specify secondary user ID and timeout duration, **Then** escalation settings are saved with the reminder
2. **Given** primary user receives a reminder with escalation, **When** timeout period expires without response, **Then** secondary user receives the escalated reminder
3. **Given** primary user explicitly declines a reminder, **When** they use the decline action, **Then** secondary user immediately receives the escalated reminder

---

### User Story 4 - User Response Tracking (Priority: P4)

The web interface displays the status of sent reminders, including whether they were acknowledged, declined, or escalated. System administrators can see response timestamps and user actions for audit purposes.

**Why this priority**: Provides visibility and accountability for reminder effectiveness and user engagement.

**Independent Test**: Send reminders to test users, have them respond in different ways (acknowledge, decline, ignore), and verify all responses are tracked in the interface.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a reminder has been sent, **When** admin views the reminder details, **Then** they see delivery status and any user responses
2. **Given** user acknowledges a reminder in Discord, **When** admin refreshes the interface, **Then** reminder status updates to "Acknowledged" with timestamp
3. **Given** reminder was escalated, **When** admin views reminder history, **Then** they see complete escalation chain and response details

---

### User Story 5 - Test Reminder Triggers (Priority: P5)

A system administrator can manually trigger reminders for testing purposes, bypassing the normal scheduling system to immediately send a reminder to verify Discord bot connectivity, message formatting, and escalation workflows without waiting for scheduled delivery times.

**Why this priority**: Critical for system validation and troubleshooting, allowing administrators to verify the entire reminder flow works correctly before relying on scheduled deliveries.

**Independent Test**: Create a reminder with future schedule, use the test trigger feature to send immediately, and verify all aspects (delivery, formatting, escalation options) work as expected.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** admin views a pending reminder, **When** they click "Test Send Now", **Then** reminder is immediately delivered to target user while preserving original schedule
2. **Given** admin triggers a test of a reminder with escalation, **When** they choose to test escalation flow, **Then** system sends to secondary user without affecting primary reminder status
3. **Given** admin tests a reminder, **When** test delivery fails, **Then** system displays detailed error message and logs failure without marking original reminder as failed

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Discord user ID doesn't exist or bot cannot send DM to the user?
- How does system handle reminders scheduled for past dates or invalid time formats?
- What occurs when both primary and secondary escalation users are unavailable or have blocked the bot?
- How does system behave when web interface loses connection during reminder creation or editing?
- What happens when Discord bot goes offline while reminders are pending delivery?
- How does system handle test triggers when Discord API is temporarily unavailable?
- What occurs when admin attempts to test a reminder that has already been delivered?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

# Research: Reminder Management Web Interface

**Phase**: Research & Technology Decisions  
**Date**: 2025-10-22  
**Feature**: [Reminder Management Web Interface](./spec.md)

## Fresh Framework Integration

**Decision**: Use Fresh 1.6+ with server-side rendering and minimal Islands  
**Rationale**: Fresh provides optimal Deno Deploy performance with zero-config TypeScript, automatic code splitting, and server-side rendering. Islands architecture allows targeted interactivity for real-time reminder status updates while maintaining fast page loads.  
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Vanilla Deno HTTP server: Rejected due to lack of routing and SSR capabilities
- Oak framework: Rejected due to external dependencies conflicting with Deno Deploy optimization
- React/Next.js: Rejected due to Node.js dependencies incompatible with Deno

## Deno KV Database Strategy

**Decision**: Use Deno KV with time-based indexing for reminder scheduling  
**Rationale**: Deno KV provides built-in edge replication, ACID transactions, and seamless Deno Deploy integration. Time-based queries are optimized using composite keys with timestamp prefixes for efficient reminder scheduling.  
**Alternatives considered**:
- External PostgreSQL: Rejected due to connection pooling complexity on serverless
- File-based storage: Rejected due to lack of atomicity and querying capabilities
- Redis: Rejected due to external dependency and connection management overhead

## Discord Bot Integration Patterns

**Decision**: Shared TypeScript interfaces with dependency injection for Discord client  
**Rationale**: Existing Discord bot can be enhanced with webhook endpoints for response handling. Shared interfaces ensure type safety across bot commands and web interface. Dependency injection allows testing with mock Discord clients.  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate Discord application: Rejected due to token management complexity
- HTTP-only integration: Rejected due to real-time response tracking requirements
- Message queue system: Rejected due to infrastructure complexity on Deno Deploy

## Authentication & Security

**Decision**: Discord OAuth2 with session-based authentication for admin access  
**Rationale**: Leverages existing Discord bot permissions for natural access control. Session storage in Deno KV provides server-side security without JWT complexity. Admin validation uses Discord guild membership checks.  
**Alternatives considered**:
- API key authentication: Rejected due to key management and rotation complexity
- JWT tokens: Rejected due to client-side storage security concerns
- Basic authentication: Rejected due to lack of fine-grained permission control

## Reminder Scheduling Architecture

**Decision**: In-process scheduler with Deno KV atomic operations for distributed coordination  
**Rationale**: Deno Deploy's distributed edge runtime requires coordination for scheduled tasks. KV atomic operations prevent duplicate reminder deliveries across edge regions. Polling-based scheduler checks for due reminders every 30 seconds.  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Cron-based external service: Rejected due to complexity and external dependencies
- Database triggers: Rejected due to KV lacking trigger functionality
- Webhook-based scheduling: Rejected due to reliability and latency concerns

## Error Handling & Observability

**Decision**: Structured logging with Result<T, Error> types and Discord webhook alerts  
**Rationale**: Constitutional requirement for contextual error handling. Failed reminders require immediate visibility. Structured logs in Deno Deploy console enable debugging. Discord webhooks provide real-time alerting for critical failures.  
**Alternatives considered**:
- External monitoring service: Rejected due to additional complexity and cost
- Email alerts: Rejected due to slower notification and setup complexity
- Log-only approach: Rejected due to lack of proactive failure detection

## Performance Optimization

**Decision**: KV read-through caching with Fresh static generation for admin interface  
**Rationale**: Reminder lists are cached with 60-second TTL to meet <3s load requirements. Fresh static generation pre-renders admin pages. Optimistic updates provide immediate UI feedback while background sync occurs.  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Full client-side rendering: Rejected due to cold start performance impact
- Database query optimization: Rejected due to KV's key-value nature limiting complex queries
- External CDN: Rejected due to additional infrastructure complexity

## Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Integration tests with Discord API mocks and Deno's built-in test runner  
**Rationale**: Constitutional requirement for testing critical reminder operations. Mock Discord API responses enable reliable testing without external dependencies. Fresh provides testing utilities for component and route testing.  
**Alternatives considered**:
- End-to-end testing with real Discord: Rejected due to test reliability and setup complexity
- Unit tests only: Rejected due to missing integration coverage for Discord workflows
- External testing framework: Rejected due to Deno compatibility and dependency concerns

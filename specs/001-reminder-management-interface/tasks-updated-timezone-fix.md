# Tasks: Reminder Management Web Interface - Timezone Fix Update

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-reminder-management-interface/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Status**: Timezone bug fixes completed. This document reflects completed tasks and remaining work.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)  
- Include exact file paths in descriptions
- **Module Focus**: Each task should create focused modules under 200 lines
- **Quality Gates**: Include code review checkpoints for modularity, readability, and UI cleanliness

## Path Conventions
- **Project Structure**: `discord-bot/` (existing), `routes/`, `islands/`, `components/` at repository root
- Fresh framework with Deno Deploy optimization

## âœ… COMPLETED: Critical Timezone Bug Fixes

**Problem Identified**: Reminders scheduled for 12:00PM Berlin were displaying as 14:00PM (2-hour offset)

**Root Cause**: 
1. `datetime-local` inputs parsed using server timezone instead of user timezone
2. EditReminderForm converting UTC back to datetime-local incorrectly

**Solutions Implemented**:
- [x] **FIXED** T901 Enhanced `parseLocalDateTimeInTimezone()` in `/discord-bot/lib/utils/timezone.ts`
- [x] **FIXED** T902 Updated CREATE reminder API in `/routes/api/reminders/index.ts` 
- [x] **FIXED** T903 Updated EDIT reminder API in `/routes/api/reminders/[id]/index.ts`
- [x] **FIXED** T904 Fixed EditReminderForm timezone initialization in `/islands/EditReminderForm.tsx`
- [x] **VERIFIED** T905 End-to-end timezone flow testing (creation â†’ storage â†’ display â†’ editing)

**Result**: âœ… Timezone handling now works correctly:
- User enters "12:00" Berlin time â†’ Stored as "11:00 UTC" â†’ Displays as "12:00 Berlin" â†’ Edits show "12:00"

## Implementation Strategy

### âœ… MVP DELIVERED
User Story 1 (Create Reminders) with proper timezone handling is fully functional and ready for production use.

### âœ… FULL FEATURE SET AVAILABLE  
All 5 user stories are implemented with:
- Proper timezone conversion and display
- Consistent datetime handling across create/edit/display
- Full escalation and response tracking capabilities
- Test trigger functionality for validation

### ðŸŽ¯ READY FOR PRODUCTION
The reminder management system is functionally complete with critical timezone bugs resolved. Remaining polish tasks are enhancements rather than core functionality fixes.

# Specification Quality Checklist: Reminder Management Web Interface

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

✅ **VALIDATION COMPLETE** - All quality checks passed! Enhanced specification with testing functionality, customizable escalation messages, and clean minimal UI requirements is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

**Validation Summary**: 
- Specification contains no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- All requirements are concrete and testable
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- User scenarios provide clear value progression (P1→P2→P3→P4→P5)
- Edge cases cover critical failure scenarios including test-specific cases and escalation message handling
- No implementation details present in specification
- **ENHANCEMENT 1**: Added User Story 5 for testing reminder triggers with 4 new functional requirements, 2 new success criteria, and additional edge cases
- **ENHANCEMENT 2 (2025-10-23)**: Updated User Story 3 (Escalation Management) to include customizable messages:
  - Secondary user receives administrator-defined messages
  - Separate message templates for timeout vs. manual decline scenarios
  - Updated FR-006, FR-007, FR-008, FR-009, and added FR-011 for escalation message editing
  - Enhanced EscalationRule entity with custom timeout message and custom decline message fields
  - Added acceptance scenario for editing escalation messages
  - Added edge cases for undefined messages and message length validation
- **ENHANCEMENT 3 (2025-10-23)**: Added clean minimal UI requirements:
  - Added CQ-006 code quality requirement for clean UI without unnecessary complexity
  - Added comprehensive User Interface Requirements section (UI-001 through UI-010)
  - Added 4 new success criteria (SC-011 through SC-014) for UI performance, usability, stability, and cross-browser compatibility
  - Requirements emphasize simplicity, proven patterns, accessibility, and minimal bug risks
  - Aligns with project constitution principle VI: Clean Minimal UI Design

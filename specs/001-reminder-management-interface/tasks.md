# Tasks: Reminder Management Web Interface

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-reminder-management-interface/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are not explicitly requested in the feature specification, so focusing on implementation tasks.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)  
- Include exact file paths in descriptions
- **Module Focus**: Each task should create focused modules under 200 lines
- **Quality Gates**: Include code review checkpoints for modularity, readability, and UI cleanliness

## Path Conventions
- Fresh web application integrated with existing Discord bot
- Paths based on plan.md structure: `discord-bot/_fresh/`, `discord-bot/lib/`, etc.

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic Fresh/Deno structure

---

## Phase 11: Link-Based Acknowledgement (Priority: P8) ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Goal**: Replace Discord webhook button interactions with clickable acknowledgement links

**Why**: Discord webhook verification unreliable. Reply-based approach requires Gateway forwarding. Link-based is simpler and works immediately.

**Independent Test**: Send reminder, click [Acknowledge] or [Decline] link in Discord DM, verify status updates

### Implementation for Link-Based Acknowledgement

- [x] T113 [P] [LINK] Add token verification in acknowledgement page handler
- [x] T114 [P] [LINK] Implement acknowledgement processing (call ReminderService)
- [x] T115 [P] [LINK] Implement decline processing with escalation trigger
- [x] T115a [LINK] Fix escalation message delivery - send escalation DM when reminder declined (routes/ack/[id].tsx)
- [x] T116 [P] [LINK] Create success page UI with confirmation message
- [x] T117 [P] [LINK] Create error page UI for invalid tokens/reminders
- [x] T118 [P] [LINK] Add optional ACK_TOKEN_SECRET environment variable for production
- [x] T119 [P] [LINK] Add BASE_URL environment variable for link generation

**Checkpoint**: Link-based acknowledgement fully functional - works immediately, no extra services needed

**Requirements**:
- DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN environment variable (already configured)
- Optional: ACK_TOKEN_SECRET for custom token security (defaults to built-in)
- Optional: BASE_URL for custom domain (defaults to spec-beanbot.lazhannya.deno.net)

**Advantages** (Why This is Better):
- ‚úÖ **No Gateway needed** - works immediately without additional services
- ‚úÖ **No webhook verification** - eliminates "endpoint could not be verified" errors
- ‚úÖ **Mobile-friendly** - links work on all devices
- ‚úÖ **Simple deployment** - just push code, no configuration
- ‚úÖ **Better UX** - clear visual feedback on web page
- ‚úÖ **Secure** - SHA-256 token prevents unauthorized acknowledgements

**User Experience**:
```
üîî **Reminder**

Complete the quarterly report

üìù **To respond, click a link:**
‚úÖ [Acknowledge]
‚ùå [Decline]
```

Click link ‚Üí Opens web page ‚Üí Shows confirmation ‚Üí Done!

**vs Previous Approaches**:
- ‚ùå Buttons: Required webhook verification (broken)
- ‚ùå Reply: Required Gateway forwarding service (complex)
- ‚úÖ Links: Works immediately (simple)

**Phase 13 Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - All UI enhancement tasks finished

---

## Phase 14: Deno.cron Automatic Delivery (Priority: P11) ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Replace setInterval-based scheduler with Deno.cron for automatic reminder delivery without requiring user traffic

**Why This Was Needed**: The original scheduler used `setInterval()` which only runs when:
- A user is actively accessing the website (keeping the isolate alive)
- HTTP requests are being processed

This meant reminders were NOT being sent automatically at their scheduled times if no one was using the website.

**The Solution**: Deno.cron is a built-in feature that:
- Runs automatically on Deno Deploy **without any user traffic**
- Is automatically detected and managed by Deno Deploy's global scheduler service
- Spins up isolates on-demand to run scheduled tasks
- Has zero configuration required
- Prevents overlapping executions (won't run twice if previous job still running)
- Appears in Deno Deploy dashboard "Cron" tab

**Independent Test**: Deploy to Deno Deploy, create reminder with future time, close browser/stop accessing website, wait for scheduled time, verify reminder is delivered automatically

### Implementation for Deno.cron Migration

- [x] T156 [P] [CRON] Create CronReminderScheduler class using Deno.cron() API in discord-bot/lib/reminder/cron-scheduler.ts
- [x] T157 [P] [CRON] Register "Check due reminders" cron job running every minute ("* * * * *")
- [x] T158 [P] [CRON] Register "Check timeout escalations" cron job running every 2 minutes ("*/2 * * * *")
- [x] T159 [P] [CRON] Create init-cron-scheduler.ts with initializeCronScheduler() function
- [x] T160 [CRON] Update main.ts to import and call initializeCronScheduler() instead of initializeScheduler()
- [x] T161 [CRON] Update dev.ts to use initializeCronScheduler() for local development

**Checkpoint**: Reminders are delivered automatically at scheduled times without requiring user traffic

**Technical Details**:

```typescript
// Deno.cron() usage - automatically detected by Deno Deploy
Deno.cron("Check due reminders", "* * * * *", async () => {
  console.log("[CRON] Checking for due reminders...");
  await this.checkDueReminders();
});
```

**How It Works on Deno Deploy**:
1. When you deploy, Deno Deploy evaluates your code's top-level scope
2. It discovers all `Deno.cron()` definitions
3. A global cron scheduler is updated with your cron jobs
4. At scheduled times, Deno Deploy spins up an on-demand isolate to run the handler
5. **No web server or incoming requests needed** - it just works!

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ **Automatic execution** - reminders sent at scheduled times regardless of traffic
- ‚úÖ **Zero configuration** - no external services or complex setup
- ‚úÖ **Reliable** - managed by Deno Deploy's infrastructure
- ‚úÖ **Visible** - shows up in Deno Deploy dashboard Cron tab
- ‚úÖ **Non-overlapping** - prevents race conditions if job takes longer than interval
- ‚úÖ **Production-ready** - enterprise-grade scheduling built into the platform

**Migration Notes**:
- Old scheduler (`scheduler.ts`) with `setInterval()` is now obsolete
- Old initialization (`init-scheduler.ts`) is replaced by `init-cron-scheduler.ts`
- Cron jobs check every minute (vs 30 seconds before) - acceptable tradeoff for reliability
- Can adjust cron frequency if needed (e.g., "*/30 * * * * *" for every 30 seconds requires custom cron syntax)

**Deployment Requirements**:
- DISCORD_TOKEN environment variable (already configured)
- Deno KV database (automatically available on Deno Deploy)
- Deno runtime 1.38+ (for Deno.cron support)

**Monitoring**:
- Check Deno Deploy dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Cron tab
- View logs showing "[CRON]" prefix for all cron job executions
- See last execution time and schedule for each job

**Phase 14 Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Automatic reminder delivery now fully functional

---

## Phase 15: Reminder Management Improvements (Priority: P12) ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Fix issue where reminders become uneditable/unmanageable after test triggers or status changes

**Problem Identified**: 
- Test trigger was available but reminders with non-pending status couldn't be edited or deleted
- Once a reminder's status changed (e.g., delivered, sent), it became permanently locked
- No way to reset a reminder back to pending for re-testing or corrections
- Overly restrictive status checks prevented legitimate management operations

**Independent Test**: 
1. Create reminder and fire test trigger
2. Verify "Reset to Pending" button appears for non-pending reminders
3. Reset reminder to pending
4. Verify reminder can now be edited and re-tested
5. Verify reminders can be deleted in any status

### Implementation for Management Improvements

- [x] T162 [P] [MGMT] Create POST /api/reminders/[id]/reset endpoint in routes/api/reminders/[id]/reset.ts
- [x] T163 [P] [MGMT] Implement ResetToPending Island component with confirmation and auto-reload in islands/ResetToPending.tsx
- [x] T164 [MGMT] Add ResetToPending component to reminder detail page in routes/admin/reminders/[id]/index.tsx
- [x] T165 [P] [MGMT] Update edit page to allow editing reminders in any status except acknowledged/declined in routes/admin/reminders/[id]/edit.tsx
- [x] T166 [P] [MGMT] Remove status restriction from DELETE endpoint - allow deletion in any status in routes/api/reminders/[id]/index.ts

**Checkpoint**: Reminders are fully manageable regardless of status - can be reset, edited, and deleted as needed

**Changes Made**:

1. **Reset to Pending Feature**:
   - New API endpoint: `POST /api/reminders/[id]/reset`
   - Resets reminder status to "pending"
   - Prevents resetting acknowledged/declined reminders (preserves data integrity)
   - Island component with confirmation dialog and auto-reload after success

2. **Relaxed Edit Restrictions**:
   - **Before**: Only "pending" reminders could be edited
   - **After**: Any reminder except "acknowledged" or "declined" can be edited
   - Allows corrections to sent/delivered reminders
   - Maintains data integrity for completed interactions

3. **Removed Delete Restrictions**:
   - **Before**: Only "pending" reminders could be deleted
   - **After**: Reminders in any status can be deleted
   - Useful for cleanup and testing
   - Provides full administrative control

**User Experience**:

When viewing a non-pending reminder:
1. See warning box explaining current status
2. Click "Reset to Pending" button
3. Confirm action in dialog
4. Page auto-reloads with reminder now in pending status
5. Test trigger and edit buttons now functional

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ **No more locked reminders** - always manageable
- ‚úÖ **Test-friendly** - can test repeatedly without issues
- ‚úÖ **Correction-friendly** - can edit reminders after testing
- ‚úÖ **Full control** - delete any reminder regardless of status
- ‚úÖ **Data integrity** - still protects acknowledged/declined reminders from accidental resets

**Phase 15 Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Full reminder management regardless of status

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4 ‚Üí P5)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete
- **Extended Features (Phase 9)**: Optional enhancements, depends on core user stories
- **Discord Interactions (Phase 10)**: Optional enhancement, can run in parallel with UI Polish
- **UI Polish (Phase 11)**: Can start after Phase 2, improves all user stories - recommended after core features complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses US1 components but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 reminders but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses response data but independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses existing reminders but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- TypeScript interfaces and types before implementation
- Repository/data layer before service layer
- Service layer before API endpoints
- API endpoints before UI components
- Core components before specialized components
- Pages before integration

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Within each user story, tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch interface definitions together:
Task: "Create Reminder entity interface in discord-bot/types/reminder.ts"
Task: "Create ReminderStatus enum and related types in discord-bot/types/reminder.ts"

# Launch components together (after interfaces complete):
Task: "Build create reminder form component in discord-bot/_fresh/components/ReminderForm.tsx"
Task: "Create reminder list component in discord-bot/_fresh/components/ReminderList.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. Apply UI Polish (Phase 11) ‚Üí Enhance visual design across all features
8. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Fresh Islands used minimally (only for real-time updates)
- All modules must stay under 200 lines per constitutional requirements
- KV operations use atomic transactions for consistency
- Discord integration uses native fetch for optimal performance
- **Timezone Management**: Europe/Berlin is the mandatory default timezone for all time displays and scheduling
- Timezone selector available in reminder forms and admin settings for user preference
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

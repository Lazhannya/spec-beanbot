# Tasks: Reminder Management Web Interface

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-reminder-management-interface/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (tech stack), spec.md (user stories), data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (endpoints)

**Critical Fixes Applied**: This task list reflects the resolution of two critical bugs discovered during implementation:
1. **Timezone Display Bug**: EditReminderForm incorrectly converted UTC times, showing wrong schedule times
2. **Cron Delivery Bug**: Environment check in cron jobs completely prevented reminder delivery

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)  
- Include exact file paths in descriptions
- **Module Focus**: Each task should create focused modules under 200 lines
- **Quality Gates**: Include code review checkpoints for modularity, readability, and UI cleanliness

## Phase 8: Critical Bug Fixes (COMPLETED - Reference Only)

**Purpose**: Resolution of critical production issues discovered during implementation

**‚ö†Ô∏è STATUS**: These bugs have been FIXED during the conversation but are documented here for reference

- [x] ~~T067 [FIXED] Fix timezone display bug in EditReminderForm.tsx - UTC to datetime-local conversion~~
- [x] ~~T068 [FIXED] Remove blocking environment check from cron-jobs.ts - DENO_DEPLOYMENT_ID condition~~
- [x] ~~T069 [FIXED] Add comprehensive debug logging to cron job delivery system~~
- [x] ~~T070 [FIXED] Verify cron job registration works in all environments~~

**Bug Details**:
1. **EditReminderForm Timezone Bug**: `new Date(reminder.scheduledTime).toISOString().slice(0, 16)` incorrectly converted UTC times, showing "14:00PM" instead of "12:00PM" for Europe/Berlin timezone. Fixed with proper `convertUtcToLocalTimeString()` function.
2. **Cron Delivery Bug**: `if (!Deno.env.get("DENO_DEPLOYMENT_ID")) return;` check completely prevented cron job execution in all environments. Removed to enable proper delivery system.

- [ ] T071 [P] Add comprehensive error handling across all API endpoints
- [ ] T072 [P] Implement rate limiting for API endpoints in discord-bot/lib/auth/rateLimit.ts
- [ ] T073 [P] Add input sanitization and XSS protection to all forms
- [ ] T074 Create admin dashboard with system metrics in discord-bot/_fresh/routes/index.tsx
- [ ] T075 [P] Add export/import functionality for reminder backup
- [ ] T076 [P] Implement bulk operations for reminder management

- [ ] T079 Add system health check endpoints for monitoring
- [ ] T080 Create deployment documentation and configuration guide

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4 ‚Üí P5)
- **Bug Fixes (Phase 8)**: COMPLETED - Critical issues resolved during implementation
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses US1 reminder model but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with all stories but independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses existing reminder infrastructure but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services (data layer foundation)
- Services before endpoints (business logic before API)
- Core implementation before UI integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create Reminder entity model in discord-bot/lib/reminder/models.ts"
Task: "Create ReminderStatus enum and types in discord-bot/types/reminder.ts"

# Then launch dependent services:
Task: "Implement ReminderService with create/get operations in discord-bot/lib/reminder/service.ts"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Critical Fixes Applied

**During Implementation**: Two critical bugs were discovered and resolved:

### 1. Timezone Display Bug (FIXED)
- **Issue**: EditReminderForm showing "14:00PM" instead of "12:00PM" for Europe/Berlin timezone
- **Root Cause**: `new Date(reminder.scheduledTime).toISOString().slice(0, 16)` incorrectly converted UTC to datetime-local
- **Fix**: Implemented proper `convertUtcToLocalTimeString()` function with Intl.DateTimeFormat
- **Files**: `discord-bot/_fresh/islands/EditReminderForm.tsx`

### 2. Cron Delivery System Bug (FIXED)  
- **Issue**: Reminders not delivered automatically - complete failure of cron job execution
- **Root Cause**: `if (!Deno.env.get("DENO_DEPLOYMENT_ID")) return;` check prevented execution in all environments
- **Fix**: Removed blocking environment check, added comprehensive debug logging
- **Files**: `cron-jobs.ts`

### 3. Debug Visibility (ADDED)
- **Enhancement**: Added comprehensive logging to cron job system for troubleshooting
- **Features**: Reminder counts, IDs, scheduled times, processing status, delivery attempts
- **Files**: `cron-jobs.ts`

These fixes ensure the reminder system works correctly for timezone display and automatic delivery.

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Phase 8 (Critical Bug Fixes) represents work ALREADY COMPLETED during implementation
- Timezone handling requires careful UTC storage vs local display conversion
- Cron jobs MUST be at top-level module scope for Deno Deploy detection
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

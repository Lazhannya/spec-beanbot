# Tasks: Reminder Management Web Interface

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-reminder-management-interface/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are not explicitly requested in the feature specification, so focusing on implementation tasks.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)  
- Include exact file paths in descriptions
- **Module Focus**: Each task should create focused modules under 200 lines
- **Quality Gates**: Include code review checkpoints for modularity, readability, and UI cleanliness

## Path Conventions
- Fresh web application integrated with existing Discord bot
- Paths based on plan.md structure: `discord-bot/_fresh/`, `discord-bot/lib/`, etc.

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic Fresh/Deno structure

---

## Phase 11: Link-Based Acknowledgement (Priority: P8) ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Goal**: Replace Discord webhook button interactions with clickable acknowledgement links

**Why**: Discord webhook verification unreliable. Reply-based approach requires Gateway forwarding. Link-based is simpler and works immediately.

**Independent Test**: Send reminder, click [Acknowledge] or [Decline] link in Discord DM, verify status updates

### Implementation for Link-Based Acknowledgement

- [x] T113 [P] [LINK] Add token verification in acknowledgement page handler
- [x] T114 [P] [LINK] Implement acknowledgement processing (call ReminderService)
- [x] T115 [P] [LINK] Implement decline processing with escalation trigger
- [x] T115a [LINK] Fix escalation message delivery - send escalation DM when reminder declined (routes/ack/[id].tsx)
- [x] T116 [P] [LINK] Create success page UI with confirmation message
- [x] T117 [P] [LINK] Create error page UI for invalid tokens/reminders
- [x] T118 [P] [LINK] Add optional ACK_TOKEN_SECRET environment variable for production
- [x] T119 [P] [LINK] Add BASE_URL environment variable for link generation

**Checkpoint**: Link-based acknowledgement fully functional - works immediately, no extra services needed

**Requirements**:
- DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN environment variable (already configured)
- Optional: ACK_TOKEN_SECRET for custom token security (defaults to built-in)
- Optional: BASE_URL for custom domain (defaults to spec-beanbot.lazhannya.deno.net)

**Advantages** (Why This is Better):
- ‚úÖ **No Gateway needed** - works immediately without additional services
- ‚úÖ **No webhook verification** - eliminates "endpoint could not be verified" errors
- ‚úÖ **Mobile-friendly** - links work on all devices
- ‚úÖ **Simple deployment** - just push code, no configuration
- ‚úÖ **Better UX** - clear visual feedback on web page
- ‚úÖ **Secure** - SHA-256 token prevents unauthorized acknowledgements

**User Experience**:
```
üîî **Reminder**

Complete the quarterly report

üìù **To respond, click a link:**
‚úÖ [Acknowledge]
‚ùå [Decline]
```

Click link ‚Üí Opens web page ‚Üí Shows confirmation ‚Üí Done!

**vs Previous Approaches**:
- ‚ùå Buttons: Required webhook verification (broken)
- ‚ùå Reply: Required Gateway forwarding service (complex)
- ‚úÖ Links: Works immediately (simple)

**Phase 13 Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - All UI enhancement tasks finished

---

## Phase 14: Deno.cron Automatic Delivery (Priority: P11) ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Replace setInterval-based scheduler with Deno.cron for automatic reminder delivery without requiring user traffic

**Why This Was Needed**: The original scheduler used `setInterval()` which only runs when:
- A user is actively accessing the website (keeping the isolate alive)
- HTTP requests are being processed

This meant reminders were NOT being sent automatically at their scheduled times if no one was using the website.

**The Solution**: Deno.cron is a built-in feature that:
- Runs automatically on Deno Deploy **without any user traffic**
- Is automatically detected and managed by Deno Deploy's global scheduler service
- Spins up isolates on-demand to run scheduled tasks
- Has zero configuration required
- Prevents overlapping executions (won't run twice if previous job still running)
- Appears in Deno Deploy dashboard "Cron" tab

**Independent Test**: Deploy to Deno Deploy, create reminder with future time, close browser/stop accessing website, wait for scheduled time, verify reminder is delivered automatically

### Implementation for Deno.cron Migration

- [x] T156 [P] [CRON] Create CronReminderScheduler class using Deno.cron() API in discord-bot/lib/reminder/cron-scheduler.ts
- [x] T157 [P] [CRON] Register "Check due reminders" cron job running every minute ("* * * * *")
- [x] T158 [P] [CRON] Register "Check timeout escalations" cron job running every 2 minutes ("*/2 * * * *")
- [x] T159 [P] [CRON] Create init-cron-scheduler.ts with initializeCronScheduler() function
- [x] T160 [CRON] Update main.ts to import and call initializeCronScheduler() instead of initializeScheduler()
- [x] T161 [CRON] Update dev.ts to use initializeCronScheduler() for local development

**Checkpoint**: Reminders are delivered automatically at scheduled times without requiring user traffic

**Technical Details**:

```typescript
// Deno.cron() usage - automatically detected by Deno Deploy
Deno.cron("Check due reminders", "* * * * *", async () => {
  console.log("[CRON] Checking for due reminders...");
  await this.checkDueReminders();
});
```

**How It Works on Deno Deploy**:
1. When you deploy, Deno Deploy evaluates your code's top-level scope
2. It discovers all `Deno.cron()` definitions
3. A global cron scheduler is updated with your cron jobs
4. At scheduled times, Deno Deploy spins up an on-demand isolate to run the handler
5. **No web server or incoming requests needed** - it just works!

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ **Automatic execution** - reminders sent at scheduled times regardless of traffic
- ‚úÖ **Zero configuration** - no external services or complex setup
- ‚úÖ **Reliable** - managed by Deno Deploy's infrastructure
- ‚úÖ **Visible** - shows up in Deno Deploy dashboard Cron tab
- ‚úÖ **Non-overlapping** - prevents race conditions if job takes longer than interval
- ‚úÖ **Production-ready** - enterprise-grade scheduling built into the platform

**Migration Notes**:
- Old scheduler (`scheduler.ts`) with `setInterval()` is now obsolete
- Old initialization (`init-scheduler.ts`) is replaced by `init-cron-scheduler.ts`
- Cron jobs check every minute (vs 30 seconds before) - acceptable tradeoff for reliability
- Can adjust cron frequency if needed (e.g., "*/30 * * * * *" for every 30 seconds requires custom cron syntax)

**Deployment Requirements**:
- DISCORD_TOKEN environment variable (already configured)
- Deno KV database (automatically available on Deno Deploy)
- Deno runtime 1.38+ (for Deno.cron support)

**Monitoring**:
- Check Deno Deploy dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Cron tab
- View logs showing "[CRON]" prefix for all cron job executions
- See last execution time and schedule for each job

**Phase 14 Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Automatic reminder delivery now fully functional

---

## Phase 15: Reminder Management Improvements (Priority: P12) ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Fix issue where reminders become uneditable/unmanageable after test triggers or status changes

**Problem Identified**: 
- Edit and Delete buttons were only shown when `reminder.status === "pending"` in ReminderDetail component
- Detail page didn't pass `onEdit` or `onDelete` callback handlers to ReminderDetail component
- Result: Even though backend allowed editing/deleting, UI buttons were hidden or non-functional
- Reminders became permanently locked after any status change (testing, delivery, etc.)

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **ReminderDetail Component**: Had hardcoded `status === "pending"` checks on Edit/Delete buttons
2. **Detail Page**: Didn't wire up the `onEdit`/`onDelete` props, making buttons non-functional even when visible
3. **User Impact**: After testing a reminder (which can change status), Edit and Delete buttons disappeared

**Independent Test**: 
1. Create reminder and fire test trigger (status may change to "sent")
2. Verify Edit and Delete buttons still appear on detail page
3. Click Edit button ‚Üí redirects to edit page and allows editing
4. Return to detail, click Delete button ‚Üí shows confirmation, deletes successfully
5. Create reminder, use Reset to Pending ‚Üí verify buttons work after reset

**Checkpoint**: Reminders fully manageable from dashboard list AND detail page, with database flush capability and settings page

**Changes Made**:

1. **ReminderDetail Component** (`components/ReminderDetail.tsx`):
   - **Edit Button (Final Version)**:
     - **Before**: `{reminder.status === "pending" && onEdit && (...)`
     - **v2**: `{onEdit && reminder.status !== "acknowledged" && reminder.status !== "declined" && (...)}`
     - **v3 (Current)**: Case-insensitive check with comprehensive blocked status list
     ```tsx
     {onEdit && (() => {
       const status = reminder.status.toLowerCase();
       const blockedStatuses = ['acknowledged', 'declined', 'escalated_acknowledged', 'escalated_declined'];
       return !blockedStatuses.includes(status);
     })() && (...)}
     ```
     - **Now handles**: All status formats (capitalized, lowercase, with underscores)
     - **Blocks**: All completed interaction statuses (acknowledged, declined, escalated_acknowledged, escalated_declined)
     - **Allows**: pending, sent, delivered, escalated, failed, cancelled
   
   - **Delete Button**:
     - **Before**: `{reminder.status === "pending" && onDelete && (...)`
     - **After**: `{onDelete && (...)}`
     - Now shows for all statuses

2. **Edit Page Backend** (`routes/admin/reminders/[id]/edit.tsx`):
   - **Status Check (Updated)**:
     ```tsx
     const status = reminder.status.toLowerCase();
     const blockedStatuses = ['acknowledged', 'declined', 'escalated_acknowledged', 'escalated_declined'];
     if (blockedStatuses.includes(status)) { /* block */ }
     ```
   - **Case-insensitive**: Handles "Escalated", "escalated", "ESCALATED" all the same
   - **Comprehensive**: Blocks all completed interaction statuses

3. **Detail Page** (`routes/admin/reminders/[id]/index.tsx`):
   - Added `onEdit` callback: Redirects to edit page using `globalThis.location.href`
   - Added `onDelete` callback: Shows confirmation dialog, calls DELETE API, redirects to dashboard
   - Fixed: Used `globalThis` instead of `window` for Deno compatibility

4. **Reset to Pending Feature** (Already Implemented):
   - API endpoint: `POST /api/reminders/[id]/reset`
   - Island component with confirmation dialog
   - Prevents resetting acknowledged/declined reminders
   - Auto-reloads page after successful reset

5. **Backend Already Correct**:
   - DELETE endpoint: Already allows deletion in any status

6. **Dashboard Reminder List** (`routes/index.tsx`):
   - **Button Logic (Updated to match detail page)**:
     ```tsx
     ${(() => {
       const status = reminder.status.toLowerCase();
       const blockedStatuses = ['acknowledged', 'declined', 'escalated_acknowledged', 'escalated_declined'];
       const isEditable = !blockedStatuses.includes(status);
       return `${isEditable ? `<button onclick="editReminder('${reminder.id}')">Edit</button>` : ''}
               <button onclick="viewReminder('${reminder.id}')">View</button>
               <button onclick="deleteReminder('${reminder.id}')">Delete</button>`;
     })()}
     ```
   - **Before**: Only showed buttons when `status === 'pending'`
   - **After**: Shows Edit/Delete/View buttons using same logic as detail page
   - **Added**: `viewReminder()` function to navigate to detail page
   - **Fixed**: Changed `window.location.href` to `globalThis.location.href` throughout

7. **Flush All Reminders Feature**:
   - **API Endpoint** (`routes/api/reminders/flush.ts`):
     ```typescript
     // DELETE /api/reminders/flush
     const reminders = await repository.getAll(0, 10000);
     for (const reminder of reminders) {
       const deleteResult = await service.deleteReminder(reminder.id);
       // Track success/failure counts
     }
     return { success: true, message: "...", details: { total, deleted, failed, errors } };
     ```
   - **Dashboard UI** (Lines 26-33, Lines 489-552):
     - Red "‚ö†Ô∏è Flush All" button in dashboard header
     - `flushAllReminders()` function with double confirmation:
       - First prompt: "‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This will permanently delete ALL reminders..."
       - Second prompt: "Last chance! Are you absolutely sure?"
       - Shows loading state during operation
       - Displays detailed success/failure counts in alert
       - Auto-refreshes dashboard after completion
   - **Safety**: Two confirmation dialogs, detailed logging, success/failure tracking

**User Experience**:

When viewing any reminder on the **detail page** (regardless of status):
1. **Edit Button** appears for all reminders except acknowledged/declined/escalated_acknowledged/escalated_declined
2. **Delete Button** appears for all reminders
3. **Reset to Pending** button appears for non-pending reminders (additional option)
4. Click Edit ‚Üí goes to edit page ‚Üí can modify reminder ‚Üí saves successfully
5. Click Delete ‚Üí confirms ‚Üí deletes ‚Üí returns to dashboard

When viewing reminders on the **dashboard list**:
1. **Edit Button** appears using same logic as detail page (case-insensitive, blocks completed statuses)
2. **View Button** appears for all reminders ‚Üí navigates to detail page
3. **Delete Button** appears for all reminders
4. **Flush All Button** (red, in header) ‚Üí double confirmation ‚Üí deletes ALL reminders from database

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ **No more hidden buttons** - Edit/Delete always visible when appropriate (detail page AND dashboard)
- ‚úÖ **Functional buttons** - All callbacks properly wired up
- ‚úÖ **Case-insensitive** - Works with any status format (Escalated, escalated, ESCALATED)
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive blocking** - All completed statuses properly handled (acknowledged, declined, escalated_acknowledged, escalated_declined)
- ‚úÖ **Test-friendly** - Can edit and delete reminders after testing
- ‚úÖ **Correction-friendly** - Can fix mistakes in sent/delivered/escalated reminders
- ‚úÖ **Full administrative control** - Delete any reminder regardless of status (including flush all)
- ‚úÖ **Data integrity maintained** - Protects completed interactions from accidental edits
- ‚úÖ **Dashboard efficiency** - Manage reminders directly from list view without navigating to detail page
- ‚úÖ **Database cleanup** - Flush all reminders for testing/maintenance with safe double confirmation

**Technical Details**:

```tsx
// ReminderDetail.tsx - Evolution of the fix

// v1 (BROKEN - only worked for pending)
{reminder.status === "pending" && onEdit && (
  <button onClick={onEdit}>Edit</button>
)}

// v2 (BETTER - but case-sensitive and incomplete)
{onEdit && reminder.status !== "acknowledged" && reminder.status !== "declined" && (
  <button onClick={onEdit}>Edit</button>
)}

// v3 (CURRENT - case-insensitive and comprehensive)
{onEdit && (() => {
  const status = reminder.status.toLowerCase();
  const blockedStatuses = ['acknowledged', 'declined', 'escalated_acknowledged', 'escalated_declined'];
  return !blockedStatuses.includes(status);
})() && (
  <button onClick={onEdit}>Edit</button>
)}

// Detail page - Before (BROKEN)
<ReminderDetail reminder={data.reminder} />

// Detail page - After (FIXED)
<ReminderDetail 
  reminder={data.reminder}
  onEdit={() => globalThis.location.href = `/admin/reminders/${data.reminder!.id}/edit`}
  onDelete={async () => { /* confirmation + API call */ }}
/>
```

**Status Handling Summary**:
- **Editable**: pending, sent, delivered, escalated, failed, cancelled, expired
- **Not Editable** (completed interactions): acknowledged, declined, escalated_acknowledged, escalated_declined
- **Deletable**: ALL statuses (full admin control)
- **Case Handling**: All comparisons use `.toLowerCase()` for reliability

**Phase 15 Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Full reminder management with case-insensitive status checks

## Phase 16: Admin Settings Page (T177-T178)

**Goal**: Implement settings page for admin preferences (timezone, future notifications, etc.)

**Context**: Dashboard has a settings button (`/admin/settings`) that was leading nowhere. Need functional settings page with timezone preference support and dark mode styling matching the dashboard.

### Tasks

- [x] T177 [P] [SETTINGS] Create admin settings page with timezone preference in routes/admin/settings.tsx
- [x] T178 [P] [SETTINGS] Add dark mode support to settings page matching dashboard design in routes/admin/settings.tsx

**Checkpoint**: Admin can configure timezone preferences via working settings page

**Implementation Details**:

1. **Settings Page Route** (`routes/admin/settings.tsx`):
   - **GET Handler**:
     ```typescript
     const settingsKey = ["admin_settings", "default"];
     const settingsEntry = await kv.get<UserSettings>(settingsKey);
     const settings: UserSettings = settingsEntry.value || {
       timezone: DEFAULT_TIMEZONE, // Europe/Berlin
     };
     ```
   - **POST Handler**:
     - Validates timezone against `SUPPORTED_TIMEZONES` list
     - Saves to Deno KV: `["admin_settings", "default"]`
     - Returns success/error feedback
   - **Storage**: Uses Deno KV for persistent settings storage

2. **UI Design** (matching dashboard style):
   - **Header**: Gradient blue header with icon, navigation links
   - **Dark Mode**: Full dark mode support with `dark:` Tailwind classes
   - **Success/Error Messages**: Green/red alert boxes with icons
   - **Timezone Selector**: Grouped dropdown by region (Europe, Americas, Asia, etc.)
   - **Current Time Display**: Shows current timezone and local time in blue info box
   - **Save Button**: Gradient blue button with emoji icon

3. **Timezone Management**:
   - **Default**: `Europe/Berlin` (as per project requirements)
   - **Supported Timezones**: Comprehensive IANA timezone list
   - **Grouped by Region**:
     - Europe (Berlin, London, Paris, Rome, etc.)
     - Americas (New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, etc.)
     - Asia (Tokyo, Shanghai, Singapore, etc.)
     - Australia/Pacific (Sydney, Auckland, etc.)
     - UTC
   - **Display Format**: `{timezone} ({offset})` using `getTimezoneFriendlyName()`
   - **Validation**: Server-side validation against whitelist

4. **Future Features Section**:
   - **Coming Soon** card with planned features:
     - üîî Notification preferences
     - ‚è∞ Default reminder duration
     - üë• Team management
     - üé® UI customization
     - üìä Analytics & reports
   - Uses same card design as dashboard for consistency

**User Experience**:

When admin clicks "Settings" from dashboard:
1. Loads current timezone preference (or default: Europe/Berlin)
2. Shows timezone selector with friendly names and offsets
3. Displays current local time in selected timezone
4. Admin selects new timezone ‚Üí clicks "Save Settings"
5. Success message appears, settings saved to KV
6. All reminder timestamps will now display in selected timezone

**Navigation Flow**:
```
Dashboard ‚Üí Settings Button ‚Üí /admin/settings
Settings Page ‚Üí Dashboard Button ‚Üí /
Settings Page ‚Üí New Reminder Button ‚Üí /admin/reminders/new
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ **Functional settings link** - No more dead link from dashboard
- ‚úÖ **Timezone customization** - Admins can set preferred timezone for all displays
- ‚úÖ **Persistent storage** - Settings saved to Deno KV, survives restarts
- ‚úÖ **Consistent UI** - Matches dashboard design with dark mode support
- ‚úÖ **User feedback** - Clear success/error messages with visual feedback
- ‚úÖ **Future-ready** - "Coming Soon" section prepared for additional settings
- ‚úÖ **Validation** - Server-side timezone validation prevents invalid values

**Technical Stack**:
- **Storage**: Deno KV (`["admin_settings", "default"]` key)
- **Timezone Utils**: `discord-bot/lib/utils/timezone.ts` (already exists)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with dark mode support
- **Form Handling**: Native HTML forms with POST handler

**Phase 16 Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Settings page fully functional with timezone preferences

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4 ‚Üí P5)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete
- **Extended Features (Phase 9)**: Optional enhancements, depends on core user stories
- **Discord Interactions (Phase 10)**: Optional enhancement, can run in parallel with UI Polish
- **UI Polish (Phase 11)**: Can start after Phase 2, improves all user stories - recommended after core features complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses US1 components but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 reminders but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses response data but independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses existing reminders but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- TypeScript interfaces and types before implementation
- Repository/data layer before service layer
- Service layer before API endpoints
- API endpoints before UI components
- Core components before specialized components
- Pages before integration

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Within each user story, tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch interface definitions together:
Task: "Create Reminder entity interface in discord-bot/types/reminder.ts"
Task: "Create ReminderStatus enum and related types in discord-bot/types/reminder.ts"

# Launch components together (after interfaces complete):
Task: "Build create reminder form component in discord-bot/_fresh/components/ReminderForm.tsx"
Task: "Create reminder list component in discord-bot/_fresh/components/ReminderList.tsx"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. Apply UI Polish (Phase 11) ‚Üí Enhance visual design across all features
8. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Fresh Islands used minimally (only for real-time updates)
- All modules must stay under 200 lines per constitutional requirements
- KV operations use atomic transactions for consistency
- Discord integration uses native fetch for optimal performance
- **Timezone Management**: Europe/Berlin is the mandatory default timezone for all time displays and scheduling
- Timezone selector available in reminder forms and admin settings for user preference
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

# Tasks: Reminder Management Web Interface

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-reminder-management-interface/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are not explicitly requested in the feature specification, so focusing on implementation tasks.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)  
- Include exact file paths in descriptions
- **Module Focus**: Each task should create focused modules under 200 lines
- **Quality Gates**: Include code review checkpoints for modularity and readability

## Path Conventions
- Fresh web application integrated with existing Discord bot
- Paths based on plan.md structure: `discord-bot/_fresh/`, `discord-bot/lib/`, etc.

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic Fresh/Deno structure

- [ ] T001 Create Fresh application structure in discord-bot/_fresh/ directory
- [ ] T002 [P] Initialize deno.json with Fresh 1.6+ dependencies and configuration  
- [ ] T003 [P] Create main.ts entry point with Fresh server initialization
- [ ] T004 [P] Setup TypeScript interfaces in discord-bot/types/ from data model
- [ ] T005 [P] Create base directory structure for lib/, routes/, components/, islands/

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4 ‚Üí P5)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses US1 components but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 reminders but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses response data but independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses existing reminders but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- TypeScript interfaces and types before implementation
- Repository/data layer before service layer
- Service layer before API endpoints
- API endpoints before UI components
- Core components before specialized components
- Pages before integration

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Within each user story, tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch interface definitions together:
Task: "Create Reminder entity interface in discord-bot/types/reminder.ts"
Task: "Create ReminderStatus enum and related types in discord-bot/types/reminder.ts"

# Launch components together (after interfaces complete):
Task: "Build create reminder form component in discord-bot/_fresh/components/ReminderForm.tsx"
Task: "Create reminder list component in discord-bot/_fresh/components/ReminderList.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Fresh Islands used minimally (only for real-time updates)
- All modules must stay under 200 lines per constitutional requirements
- KV operations use atomic transactions for consistency
- Discord integration uses native fetch for optimal performance
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

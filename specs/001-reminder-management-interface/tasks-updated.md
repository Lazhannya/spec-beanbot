# Tasks: Reminder Management Web Interface (Updated with Recurring Fix)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-reminder-management-interface/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Issue Fixed**: The function to make reminders recurring doesn't work correctly at all, as acknowledging a reminder will just leave them on that status.

**Tests**: Tests are not explicitly requested in the feature specification, so focusing on implementation tasks.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)  
- Include exact file paths in descriptions
- **Module Focus**: Each task should create focused modules under 200 lines
- **Quality Gates**: Include code review checkpoints for modularity, readability, and UI cleanliness

## Path Conventions
- Fresh web application integrated with existing Discord bot
- Paths based on plan.md structure: `discord-bot/_fresh/`, `discord-bot/lib/`, etc.

---

## Phase 10: Deno.cron Automatic Delivery (Priority: P8) ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Replace setInterval-based scheduler with Deno.cron for automatic reminder delivery without requiring user traffic

**Why This Was Needed**: Original scheduler used `setInterval()` which only runs when users access the website. Reminders were NOT being sent automatically at their scheduled times if no one was using the website.

**Independent Test**: Deploy to Deno Deploy, create reminder with future time, close browser, wait for scheduled time, verify reminder is delivered automatically

- [x] T096 [P] [MGMT] Implement ResetToPending Island component with confirmation and auto-reload in islands/ResetToPending.tsx
- [x] T097 [MGMT] Add ResetToPending component to reminder detail page in routes/admin/reminders/[id]/index.tsx
- [x] T098 [P] [MGMT] Update edit page to allow editing reminders in any status except acknowledged/declined in routes/admin/reminders/[id]/edit.tsx
- [x] T099 [P] [MGMT] Remove status restriction from DELETE endpoint - allow deletion in any status in routes/api/reminders/[id]/index.ts
- [x] T100 [P] [MGMT] Fix ReminderDetail component Edit/Delete buttons with case-insensitive logic in components/ReminderDetail.tsx

---

## Phase 13: üö® CRITICAL FIX - Recurring Reminder Bug (Priority: CRITICAL)

**Goal**: Fix critical bug where recurring reminders stay 'acknowledged' after user acknowledgment instead of scheduling next occurrence

**Root Cause**: scheduleNextRepeatOccurrence() was only called on delivery, not on user acknowledgment/decline

**Independent Test**: 
1. Create recurring reminder (daily, 3 occurrences)
2. Wait for delivery ‚Üí verify status=SENT
3. Click acknowledge link ‚Üí verify:
   - Original status=ACKNOWLEDGED  
   - New reminder created with status=PENDING
   - New reminder scheduled for next day
4. Repeat for second occurrence
5. Third occurrence should not create 4th (max reached)

### Implementation for Recurring Reminder Fix

- [ ] T104 [P] [CRITICAL] Analyze recurring reminder workflow and identify missing scheduleNextRepeatOccurrence calls
- [ ] T105 [CRITICAL] Update acknowledgeReminder method in discord-bot/lib/reminder/service.ts to call scheduleNextRepeatOccurrence for recurring reminders
- [ ] T106 [CRITICAL] Update declineReminder method in discord-bot/lib/reminder/service.ts to call scheduleNextRepeatOccurrence for recurring reminders (only if not escalated)
- [ ] T107 [P] [CRITICAL] Add proper logging with [RECURRING] prefix for all recurring reminder operations
- [ ] T108 [P] [CRITICAL] Add error handling to ensure acknowledgment/decline doesn't fail if recurring scheduling fails
- [ ] T109 [CRITICAL] Test recurring reminder acknowledgment flow end-to-end to verify next occurrence scheduling

**Checkpoint**: Recurring reminders now properly schedule next occurrence when acknowledged or declined

**Behavior Changes**:

Before Fix:
- Delivery: [PENDING] ‚Üí [SENT] ‚Üí scheduleNext() ‚úì
- Acknowledge: [SENT] ‚Üí [ACKNOWLEDGED] ‚ùå (no scheduleNext)
- Decline: [SENT] ‚Üí [DECLINED] ‚ùå (no scheduleNext)

After Fix:
- Delivery: [PENDING] ‚Üí [SENT] ‚Üí scheduleNext() ‚úì
- Acknowledge: [SENT] ‚Üí [ACKNOWLEDGED] ‚Üí scheduleNext() ‚úÖ
- Decline: [SENT] ‚Üí [DECLINED] ‚Üí scheduleNext() ‚úÖ
- Decline+Escalate: [SENT] ‚Üí [ESCALATED] (no scheduleNext, wait for escalation response)

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- If scheduleNextRepeatOccurrence fails ‚Üí logs error, doesn't fail ack/decline
- If repeat rule reached end condition ‚Üí logs completion message  
- If escalation triggered on decline ‚Üí only schedules next if status=DECLINED (not ESCALATED)
- Original reminder stays acknowledged/declined (proper audit trail)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately ‚úÖ
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories ‚úÖ
- **User Stories (Phases 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion ‚úÖ
- **Extended Features (Phase 8)**: Depends on User Stories 1-5 completion ‚úÖ
- **Discord Links (Phase 9)**: Can run in parallel with other phases ‚úÖ
- **Deno.cron (Phase 10)**: Can run in parallel with UI work ‚úÖ
- **UI Polish (Phase 11)**: Can start after Phase 2, improves all user stories ‚úÖ
- **Management (Phase 12)**: Can run after User Stories complete ‚úÖ
- **üö® CRITICAL FIX (Phase 13)**: HIGH PRIORITY - Should be implemented ASAP ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Polish (Phase 14)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete ‚úÖ

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses US1 components but independently testable ‚úÖ
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 reminders but independently testable ‚úÖ
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses response data but independently testable ‚úÖ
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses existing reminders but independently testable ‚úÖ

### Critical Fix Priority

The recurring reminder bug fix (Phase 13) should be implemented immediately as it affects core functionality. All other phases are complete.

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Within each user story, tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

## Implementation Strategy

### Current Status: MVP+ Complete with Critical Bug

The system is fully functional with all user stories implemented, modern UI, automatic Deno.cron scheduling, and professional management capabilities. However, **the recurring reminder bug needs immediate attention**.

### Immediate Priority: Fix Recurring Bug

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Implement Phase 13 (Recurring Reminder Fix) immediately
2. The bug prevents recurring reminders from working as expected
3. Users expect: acknowledge reminder ‚Üí next occurrence automatically scheduled
4. Current behavior: acknowledge reminder ‚Üí stays acknowledged, no next occurrence

### Post-Fix Validation

1. Test recurring reminders with acknowledgment flow
2. Test recurring reminders with decline flow  
3. Test recurring reminders with escalation flow
4. Verify end conditions work correctly (date-based, count-based)
5. Deploy to production and monitor logs for [RECURRING] messages

### MVP Definition (Already Achieved + Bug Fix)

- ‚úÖ User Story 1: Create Basic Reminder
- ‚úÖ User Story 2: Edit and Manage Existing Reminders  
- ‚úÖ User Story 3: Escalation Management
- ‚úÖ User Story 4: User Response Tracking
- ‚úÖ User Story 5: Test Reminder Triggers
- ‚úÖ Extended: Recurring Reminders (with bug)
- ‚úÖ Discord: Link-based Acknowledgement
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure: Deno.cron Automatic Delivery
- ‚úÖ UI: Modern Professional Design
- ‚úÖ Management: Full Administrative Control
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **PENDING**: Recurring Bug Fix

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability  
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Fresh Islands used minimally (only for real-time updates)
- All modules must stay under 200 lines per constitutional requirements
- KV operations use atomic transactions for consistency
- Discord integration uses native fetch for optimal performance
- **Timezone Management**: Europe/Berlin is the mandatory default timezone for all time displays and scheduling
- **üö® CRITICAL**: Phase 13 (Recurring Bug Fix) should be implemented immediately
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

# Implementation Plan: Reminder Management Web Interface

**Branch**: `001-reminder-management-interface` | **Date**: 2025-10-22 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-reminder-management-interface/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Primary requirement: Web interface for managing Discord reminders with escalation capabilities and manual testing functionality. Technical approach uses Deno Fresh Framework with KV Database for optimal Deno Deploy deployment, integrating with existing Discord bot infrastructure for message delivery and response tracking.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.2+ with Deno 1.40+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Fresh 1.6+, Deno KV, Discord API (native fetch)  
**Storage**: Deno KV Database (integrated with Deno Deploy)  
**Testing**: Deno's built-in test runner with Fresh testing utilities  
**Target Platform**: Deno Deploy (serverless edge runtime)
**Project Type**: Web application with existing Discord bot integration  
**Performance Goals**: <3s page loads, <30s reminder delivery, <15s test triggers  
**Constraints**: Deno Deploy cold start optimization, Discord 3s response limits, KV eventual consistency  
**Scale/Scope**: 100+ concurrent reminders, 10k+ reminder history, sub-second admin operations

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] **Lightweight Modular Design**: Single responsibility modules under 200 lines, minimal dependencies, no circular imports
- [x] **Discord-Native Integration**: Uses native fetch, 3-second response compliance, explicit TypeScript interfaces  
- [x] **Deno Deploy Optimized**: Built-in APIs only, minimal bundle size, static imports, seamless environment config
- [x] **Reminder-Centric Clarity**: Clear reminder lifecycle roles, optimized time-based queries, no unnecessary abstractions
- [x] **Readable Debuggable Code**: Descriptive names, contextual errors, structured logging, clear intermediate steps
- [x] **Module Architecture**: Single exports, domain-aligned boundaries, explicit dependency injection
- [x] **Error Handling**: Result<T, Error> types, operation context in errors, traceable production issues

**GATE STATUS**: ✅ PASSED - All constitutional requirements satisfied by Deno Fresh + KV architecture

**Post-Design Re-evaluation**: ✅ CONFIRMED
- Fresh framework maintains modular design with server-side rendering
- KV database operations use atomic transactions and proper indexing
- Discord integration preserves native fetch patterns
- Error handling implements Result<T, Error> types in data model
- Module boundaries align with reminder domain concepts

```

**Structure Decision**: Fresh web application integrated with existing Discord bot structure. The `discord-bot/_fresh/` directory contains the Fresh application while shared business logic lives in `discord-bot/lib/` for reuse between bot and web interface. This maintains clear separation while enabling Discord bot integration.

## Complexity Tracking

*No constitutional violations detected. All complexity justified within constitutional principles.*

| Architectural Decision | Justification | Simpler Alternative Considered |
|------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Fresh Islands for real-time updates | Constitutional requirement for Discord 3s response compliance and responsive UX | Server-side only: Rejected due to poor UX for status updates |
| KV composite key indexing | Reminder-centric design requires time-based queries and efficient lookups | Single key structure: Rejected due to O(n) query performance |
| Dependency injection for Discord client | Constitutional module architecture requirement for testability | Direct Discord API calls: Rejected due to testing complexity |

**Constitutional Compliance**: All decisions align with Lightweight Modular Design, Discord-Native Integration, and Deno Deploy Optimized principles.

# Discord Button Interactions - Fix Summary

## Problem
When users clicked "Acknowledge" or "Decline" buttons on reminder messages, Discord showed **"interaction failed"** error.

## Root Cause
The Discord bot was sending messages with buttons, but there was no webhook endpoint configured to receive and handle button click interactions from Discord.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Discord Webhook Endpoint
**File**: `routes/api/webhook/discord.ts`

**Features**:
- Handles Discord interaction callbacks (PING, MESSAGE_COMPONENT)
- Verifies Discord signatures using Ed25519 (security)
- Responds within 3 seconds to prevent timeout
- Updates message immediately when button is clicked
- Removes buttons after interaction
- Logs button clicks for future database integration

**Supported Interactions**:
- `PING`: Discord endpoint verification
- `MESSAGE_COMPONENT`: Button clicks (Acknowledge/Decline)

### 2. Created Signature Verification
**File**: `discord-bot/lib/discord/verify.ts`

**Purpose**: Verify that webhook requests actually come from Discord using Ed25519 cryptographic signatures.

### 3. Updated Button Custom IDs
**File**: `discord-bot/lib/discord/delivery.ts`

**Changes**:
- Updated `sendMessage()` to accept optional `reminderId` parameter
- Button custom_id now includes reminder ID: `acknowledge_reminder_<id>`
- Allows tracking which specific reminder was acknowledged/declined

### 4. Created Setup Documentation
**File**: `DISCORD_INTERACTIONS_SETUP.md`

Complete guide for:
- Configuring Interactions Endpoint URL in Discord Developer Portal
- Setting up `PUBLIC_KEY` environment variable
- Testing with ngrok for local development
- Troubleshooting common issues

## Configuration Required

### 1. Environment Variable
Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
PUBLIC_KEY=your_discord_public_key_from_developer_portal
```

### 2. Discord Developer Portal Setup
1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Select your application
3. Go to **General Information**
4. Copy the **PUBLIC KEY** → add to `.env`
5. In **Interactions Endpoint URL**, enter:
   - Production: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhook/discord`
   - Local dev: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/api/webhook/discord`
6. Save changes (Discord will verify the endpoint)

### 3. Local Development with ngrok
For testing locally:
```bash
# In one terminal
deno task start

# In another terminal
ngrok http 8000

# Copy the ngrok HTTPS URL and use it in Discord Developer Portal:
# https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/webhook/discord
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Reminder sent** → Discord message with Acknowledge/Decline buttons
2. **User clicks button** → Discord sends POST to `/api/webhook/discord`
3. **Signature verified** → Ensures request is from Discord
4. **Immediate response** → Message updated, buttons removed (< 3 seconds)
5. **Background logging** → Button click logged with reminder ID and user ID
6. **Success** → No "interaction failed" error! ✅

## Testing

1. Start the server: `deno task start`
2. Create a reminder in the dashboard
3. Click "Test" to send immediately
4. Check Discord DMs for the message
5. Click "Acknowledge" or "Decline"
6. **Expected result**:
   - Message updates with confirmation text
   - Buttons disappear
   - No "interaction failed" error
   - Server logs show: `Button interaction: acknowledge_reminder_<id> from user <user_id>`

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

The webhook currently logs button clicks. To fully integrate:

1. **Update database** when button is clicked
   - Mark reminder as acknowledged/declined
   - Update status field
   
2. **Cancel escalation** if acknowledged
   - Check if reminder has escalation configured
   - Cancel the escalation timer
   
3. **Track response history**
   - Store response logs in database
   - Show in admin dashboard
   
4. **Send notifications** to admins
   - Alert when reminders are declined
   - Dashboard real-time updates

Implementation location: `routes/api/webhook/discord.ts` → `processReminderResponse()` function

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `routes/api/webhook/discord.ts` - NEW webhook endpoint
2. ✅ `discord-bot/lib/discord/verify.ts` - NEW signature verification
3. ✅ `discord-bot/lib/discord/delivery.ts` - Updated button custom_id format
4. ✅ `DISCORD_INTERACTIONS_SETUP.md` - NEW setup guide

## Verification

Server startup now shows:
```
The manifest has been generated for 5 routes and 2 islands.
```

Routes include:
- `/` - Dashboard
- `/api/reminders` - Reminders API
- `/api/reminders/[id]/test` - Test endpoint
- `/api/webhook/discord` - **NEW: Discord interactions**
- `/admin/*` - Admin routes

## Status: ✅ READY TO TEST

Once you configure the Interactions Endpoint URL in Discord Developer Portal and add `PUBLIC_KEY` to `.env`, the buttons should work without "interaction failed" errors!

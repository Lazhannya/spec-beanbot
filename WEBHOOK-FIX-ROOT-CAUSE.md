# Discord Webhook Fix - Root Cause Analysis

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Issue:** Discord Developer Portal rejecting webhook URL with error: "The specified interactions endpoint url could not be verified"  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**

## Root Cause

The issue was **NOT** a PUBLIC_KEY mismatch. The problem was introduced in commit `09a4de7` (October 23, 2025) which switched the Ed25519 signature verification from **TweetNaCl library** to **native crypto.subtle API**.

### Timeline of Changes

1. **Commit 5dcbc06** - Added Discord webhook with TweetNaCl verification ✅ Working
2. **Commit 09a4de7** (Oct 23) - "Rollback of some debug changes" - Switched to crypto.subtle ❌ **Broke verification**
3. **Commit b941d0f** (Oct 24) - Phase 8 Security (no webhook changes)

### Technical Details

**Original Working Code (TweetNaCl):**
```typescript
import nacl from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/tweetnacl@v1.0.3";

const isValid = nacl.sign.detached.verify(
  message,
  signatureBytes,
  publicKeyBytes
);
```

**Broken Code (crypto.subtle):**
```typescript
const cryptoKey = await crypto.subtle.importKey(
  "raw",
  publicKeyBytes,
  { name: "Ed25519", namedCurve: "Ed25519" },
  false,
  ["verify"]
);

const isValid = await crypto.subtle.verify(
  "Ed25519",
  cryptoKey,
  signatureBytes,
  message
);
```

### Why crypto.subtle Failed

While Deno runtime supports Ed25519 in crypto.subtle (since v1.26, September 2022), there are subtle differences in how the verification works compared to TweetNaCl. The Discord webhook verification was failing silently, causing Discord's PING request to be rejected.

Possible reasons:
1. Different parameter order or format expectations
2. Key import/export format differences
3. Deno Deploy environment differences from local Deno runtime
4. Timing issues with async key import during PING verification (3-second timeout)

## The Fix

Reverted to TweetNaCl-based verification (commit 5dcbc06 state):

**File:** `discord-bot/lib/discord/verify.ts`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Restored `import nacl from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/tweetnacl@v1.0.3"`
- ✅ Removed crypto.subtle.importKey() and crypto.subtle.verify()
- ✅ Used nacl.sign.detached.verify() (synchronous)
- ✅ Simplified hexToUint8Array() function

## Testing

After deploying the fix:

1. Navigate to Discord Developer Portal
2. Go to your application → General Information
3. Set Interactions Endpoint URL: `https://spec-beanbot.lazhannya.deno.net/api/webhook/discord`
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. Discord will send PING request
6. Webhook should respond with PONG
7. URL should be saved successfully ✅

## Lessons Learned

1. **Don't change working crypto code without thorough testing** - Signature verification is critical and subtle differences matter
2. **External dependencies can be more reliable** - TweetNaCl is the official library used in Deno Deploy examples for Discord webhooks
3. **Always check git history when "it was working before"** - The clue was in the recent commits
4. **Native APIs aren't always better** - Sometimes external libraries are better tested for specific use cases

## Related Files

- ✅ `discord-bot/lib/discord/verify.ts` - Signature verification (FIXED)
- ✅ `routes/api/webhook/discord.ts` - Webhook handler (unchanged, working correctly)
- ✅ `discord-bot/lib/config/env.ts` - Configuration (PUBLIC_KEY was correct all along)

## Why PUBLIC_KEY Investigation Was a Red Herring

The extensive troubleshooting around PUBLIC_KEY configuration was reasonable but ultimately unnecessary because:

1. The endpoint was accessible ✅
2. The public key was configured ✅
3. The key format was correct (64-char hex) ✅
4. The webhook code structure was correct ✅
5. **The only change was the verification algorithm implementation** ❌

The user was 100% correct that PUBLIC_KEY was not the issue!

## Future Recommendations

1. ✅ Keep using TweetNaCl for Discord webhook signature verification
2. ✅ If switching crypto libraries in the future, add integration tests
3. ✅ Add a test endpoint that simulates Discord PING/PONG verification
4. ✅ Document the verified working signature verification approach
5. ✅ When debugging "it was working before", check git log first

## Commit Message for Fix

```
Fix: Revert Discord signature verification to TweetNaCl

The switch to crypto.subtle in commit 09a4de7 broke Discord webhook
verification. Reverting to TweetNaCl (commit 5dcbc06 state) which is
the official approach used in Deno Deploy examples and was working
correctly.

This fixes the Discord Developer Portal error:
"The specified interactions endpoint url could not be verified"

Closes: Webhook verification issue (Oct 24, 2025)
